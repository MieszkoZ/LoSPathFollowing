# LoSPathFollowing

Line-of-Sight-based path following optimization that makes up for awkward paths that get generated around navmesh tile edges.
This code used to be part of the basing PathFollowingComponent but for unknown to me reasons has been cut a long time ago. We might bring it back at some point, but for now putting it here for public access.
Enjoy.
